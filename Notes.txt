Name ideas:
- something with "proof"
- something with "implies"

Proof Play

objects
- positional data

dragging -> mouseOn & mouseOff

mouseOn -> tracks mouse and edits absolute position of object 
                make sure that objects doesn't go out of bounds
                    factor in size of objects into outOfBounds check
                (optional) check if mouse is on dropzone of a machine
                    or accomplish with CSS

mouseOff -> 

Potential Ideas:
- Level selector / main menu and ability to load levels from levels.js.
- Add sounds (and potentially a different sound for completing level ten).
- Add negation.
- Ability for users to create their own levels.
- Replace variables / connectors with the box symbols.
